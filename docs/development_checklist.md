- [ ] Balance difficulty curves for combat, puzzles, exploration.

## 4. Systems Architecture
- [ ] Document overall Three.js scene graph structure (world, UI overlays, post-processing).
- [ ] Choose ECS or component-based architecture for entities.
- [ ] Plan state management approach (Finite State Machines, Behavior Trees).
- [ ] Decide on data format for levels and dialogue (JSON, YAML).
- [ ] Establish save/load system specs (local storage, cloud sync options).
- [ ] Outline modularity strategy for reusable shaders and materials.

## 5. Technical Foundations
- [ ] Set up project scaffolding with bundler (Vite/Webpack) and TypeScript configuration.
- [ ] Configure linting, prettier formatting, and commit hooks.
- [ ] Implement responsive canvas scaling with DPR awareness.
- [ ] Integrate debug UI tooling (dat.GUI or Leva) with toggles for QA.
- [ ] Establish performance telemetry (FPS overlay, CPU/GPU profiling hooks).
- [ ] Build automated smoke tests for scene loading and player spawn.

## 6. Art & Animation Pipeline
- [ ] Create concept art for protagonist, companion creature, major enemies.
- [ ] Define color palette and lighting mood boards.
- [ ] Select 3D modeling workflow (Blender) and export guidelines (GLTF/GLB).
- [ ] Build rigged character models with blendshapes for facial expressions.
- [ ] Produce animation sets (idle, walk, run, jump, glide, attack, emote).
- [ ] Establish shader library for stylized rendering (rim light, toon shading, bloom).
- [ ] Prepare environment modular kits (trees, ruins, platforms, flora).
- [ ] Set up texture compression pipeline (KTX2/Basis) for web delivery.

## 7. Audio & Music
- [ ] Compose main theme and ambient exploration tracks.
- [ ] Record or source creature vocalizations and interaction sounds.
- [ ] Implement dynamic music layers responding to player state.
- [ ] Add spatial audio cues (waterfalls, critter calls, collectible chimes).
- [ ] Integrate accessibility-friendly audio mix presets.
- [ ] Build audio event map linked to gameplay systems.

## 8. UX & UI
- [ ] Wireframe HUD (health, stamina, compass, companion mood meter).
- [ ] Prototype diegetic menu concepts (glowing journal, rune compass).
- [ ] Test controller, keyboard, and touch input schemes.
- [ ] Design tutorial prompts and progressive hint system.
- [ ] Implement photo mode UI and controls.
- [ ] Conduct usability sessions on navigation clarity and readability.

## 9. Level Design & Content
- [ ] Produce whitebox layouts for each region (Blooming Basin, Crystal Canopy, Luminous Caverns).
- [ ] Mark creature spawn points, puzzles, and collectibles per region.
- [ ] Script dynamic events (meteor showers, companion side quests).
- [ ] Create vertical slice level with full polish target.
- [ ] Build streaming/occlusion strategy for performance.
- [ ] Iterate on traversal challenges with playtest feedback.

## 10. Companion & Creature Systems
- [ ] Define companion behavior states (follow, scout, cheer, warn).
- [ ] Implement trust/friendship progression mechanics.
- [ ] Design creature ecologies and inter-species interactions.
- [ ] Build soothing/comforting mini-game interactions.
- [ ] Create collectible creature cards with lore entries.
- [ ] Ensure AI respects player navigation mesh boundaries.

## 11. Visual FX & Post-processing
- [ ] Develop stylized particle effects for abilities and environmental ambience.
- [ ] Configure post-processing stack (bloom, depth of field, chromatic accents).
- [ ] Implement day-night cycle lighting variations.
- [ ] Optimize effect budgets for mobile performance.
- [ ] Add feedback VFX for hits, dodges, and friend-making moments.

## 12. Monetization & Live Ops (if applicable)
- [ ] Decide on business model (premium one-time purchase vs. cosmetic DLC).
- [ ] Plan cosmetic pipeline (outfits, glider trails, companion accessories).
- [ ] Create roadmap for seasonal events or limited-time challenges.
- [ ] Implement analytics respecting privacy regulations.
- [ ] Define community engagement strategy (dev logs, feedback portals).

## 13. Quality Assurance
