# Codex Cute Game Design Docs

This repository currently contains pre-production documentation for **Aurora Glade Adventure**, a cozy third-person exploratory-action experience built with Three.js.

## Documents
- [`docs/development_checklist.md`](docs/development_checklist.md): Comprehensive milestone and task checklist covering planning through post-launch support.
- [`docs/game_design_document.md`](docs/game_design_document.md): Full game design document outlining story, systems, art direction, and technical plans.

Future updates will expand these documents and introduce prototypes as development progresses.
